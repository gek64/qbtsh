## FAQ

### Does this tool support FreeBSD?

- Not supported, [userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static](https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases) only
  supports `linux` kernel systems, and builds a fully static `qBittorrent-nox` on `FreeBSD` is quite a difficult thing.

### Is there any way to get this working on FreeBSD?

- You can try compiling a dynamically linked `qBittorrent-nox` yourself using the `qBittorrent-nox` build script I wrote
  for `FreeBSD` [freebsd build](https://github.com/gek64/qbittorrent-nox), also I have already compiled binaries for the
  latest `FreeBSD`/`amd64`, you can also use them directly.

### How to access after running?

- After the service runs successfully, you can access it at `SERVER_IP:8080`. The default user name is `admin`, and the
  default password can be found in service log. Although you can use it normally at this time, I still recommend you to
  change the
  password in time, use reverse proxy that provided by `apache` or `nginx` and enable `https`, then
  change the listening address of `qBittorrent-nox` from `0.0.0.0` to `127.0.0.1` to improve security.
